# Handoff Ticket Template

Every ticket is written for an executor model that has **zero context**: it has not seen the advisor session, the audit, the other tickets, or any prior conversation. It may be a smaller/cheaper model. Assume it is competent at following explicit instructions and weak at filling gaps, recovering from ambiguity, or knowing when to stop.

Three properties make a ticket executable by a weaker model:

1. **Self-contained context** — everything needed is in the ticket body: paths, code excerpts, conventions, commands.
2. **Verification gates** — every step ends with a command and its expected result. The executor never has to _judge_ whether it succeeded.
3. **Hard boundaries and escape hatches** — explicit out-of-scope list, and "STOP and report" conditions instead of letting the model improvise when reality doesn't match the ticket.

The ticket **title** is the imperative finding title (what will be true once it's done). Everything below is the ticket **body**.

## Body template

```markdown
> **Executor instructions**: Follow this ticket step by step. Run every
> verification command and confirm the expected result before moving to the
> next step. If anything in the "STOP conditions" section occurs, stop and
> report — do not improvise. Set this ticket to `in_progress` when you start
> and `done` when the done criteria all hold (unless a reviewer dispatched
> you and told you they own the status).
>
> **Drift check (run first)**: `git diff --stat <planned-at SHA>..HEAD -- <in-scope paths>`
> If any in-scope file changed since this ticket was written, compare the
> "Current state" excerpts against the live code before proceeding; on a
> mismatch, treat it as a STOP condition.

## Status

- **Effort**: S | M | L
- **Risk**: LOW | MED | HIGH
- **Category**: bug | security | perf | tests | tech-debt | migration | dx | docs | direction
- **Planned at**: commit `<short SHA>`, <YYYY-MM-DD>

(Effort/Risk/Category also live as labels on the ticket — `effort:M`, `risk:low`,
and the category — so they filter from the board; the body restates them for the
executor. Dependencies are the ticket's `blocked_by`, not a line here.)

## Why this matters

2–5 sentences. The problem, its concrete cost, and what improves when this
lands. Written so the executor (and a human reviewer) understands the intent —
intent is what lets a correct judgment call happen when a detail is off.

## Current state

The facts the executor needs, inlined — never "as discussed" or "see audit":

- The relevant files, each with one line on its role:
  - `src/orders/api.ts` — order-list endpoint; contains the N+1 (lines 130–160)
- Excerpts of the code as it exists today (short, with `file:line` markers),
  enough that the executor can confirm it's looking at the right thing.
- The repo conventions that apply here, with a pointer to one exemplar file:
  "Error handling follows the Result pattern — see `src/lib/result.ts` and its
  use in `src/users/api.ts:40-60`. Match it."
- Any documented vocabulary or design constraints the plan must honor, inlined
  from the intent/design docs found in recon: the relevant `CONTEXT.md` terms
  the executor should use in names and comments, the `DESIGN.md` tokens/components
  to reuse, or the ADR whose decision this work must stay consistent with. Quote
  the specific lines — the executor has not read those docs.

## Commands you will need

| Purpose   | Command                 | Expected on success |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| Install   | `pnpm install`          | exit 0              |
| Typecheck | `pnpm typecheck`        | exit 0, no errors   |
| Tests     | `pnpm test -- <filter>` | all pass            |
| Lint      | `pnpm lint`             | exit 0              |

(Exact commands from this repo — verified during recon, not guessed.)

## Suggested executor toolkit

(Optional — include only when relevant skills/tools plausibly exist in the
executor's environment. Skip the section otherwise.)

- Skills the executor should invoke if available, and for what:
  "use `vercel-react-best-practices` when writing the memoization in step 3".
- Reference docs worth reading before starting, by path or URL.

## Scope

**In scope** (the only files you should modify):

- `src/orders/api.ts`
- `src/orders/api.test.ts` (create)

**Out of scope** (do NOT touch, even though they look related):

- `src/orders/legacy-api.ts` — deprecated path, scheduled for deletion;
  changing it wastes effort and risks the v1 clients still pinned to it.
- Any change to the public response shape — clients depend on it.

## Git workflow

(Filled from recon — match the repo's observed conventions.)

- Branch: `advisor/<slug>` (or the repo's branch-naming convention if one is evident)
- Commit per step or per logical unit; message style: <match repo, e.g. conventional commits — include an example from `git log`>
- Do NOT push or open a PR unless the operator instructed it.

## Steps

### Step 1: <imperative title>

What to do, precisely. Reference exact files/symbols. Include the target code
shape when it's load-bearing (the pattern to produce, not necessarily every
line).

**Verify**: `<command>` → <expected output>

### Step 2: ...

(Each step small enough to verify independently. Order steps so the codebase
is never broken between steps when possible — e.g. add new path, switch
callers, then remove old path.)

## Test plan

- New tests to write, in which file, covering which cases (list them:
  happy path, the specific bug/regression this ticket fixes, named edge cases).
- Which existing test to use as the structural pattern:
  "model after `src/users/api.test.ts`".
- Verification: `<test command>` → all pass, including N new tests.

## Done criteria

Machine-checkable. ALL must hold:

- [ ] `pnpm typecheck` exits 0
- [ ] `pnpm test` exits 0; new tests for <X> exist and pass
- [ ] `grep -rn "<old pattern>" src/` returns no matches
- [ ] No files outside the in-scope list are modified (`git status`)
- [ ] This ticket set to `done` in meldom

## STOP conditions

Stop and report back (do not improvise) if:

- The code at the locations in "Current state" doesn't match the excerpts
  (the codebase has drifted since this ticket was written).
- A step's verification fails twice after a reasonable fix attempt.
- The fix appears to require touching an out-of-scope file.
- You discover the assumption "<key assumption>" is false.

## Maintenance notes

For the human/agent who owns this code after the change lands:

- What future changes will interact with this (e.g. "if pagination is added
  to this endpoint, the batching in step 2 must be revisited").
- What a reviewer should scrutinize in the PR.
- Any follow-up explicitly deferred out of this ticket (and why).
```

## The index is meldom

There is no README to write. The meldom ticket list is the index, the ticket
statuses are the status column, and the `blocked_by` graph is the dependency
order:

- **TODO** → ticket `open`.
- **IN PROGRESS** → ticket `in_progress`.
- **DONE** → ticket `done` (with a reason); `closed` is the human's later archive.
- **BLOCKED** → leave it `open` with a comment naming the blocker, and an
  unresolved `blocked_by` edge so `ticket_list` with `unblocked: true` won't
  surface it.
- **REJECTED** (finding fixed independently or approach abandoned) → ticket
  `closed` with a one-line reason, so nobody re-audits it.

`ticket_list` with `unblocked: true` returns the ready, unblocked work;
`ticket_list` shows the whole backlog. Findings considered and rejected are
closed tickets with their rationale in the reason — that's the record.

## Quality bar — check before finishing each ticket

- Could a model that has never seen this repo execute this with only the ticket and the repo? If any step requires knowledge from the advisor session, inline that knowledge.
- Is every verification a command with an expected result, not a judgment ("make sure it works")?
- Does every step name exact files and symbols, not "the relevant module"?
- Are the STOP conditions specific to this ticket's actual risks, not boilerplate?
- Would a reviewer reading only "Why this matters" + "Done criteria" understand what they're approving?
- No secret values anywhere in the body — locations and credential types only.
- "Planned at" SHA is filled in and the in-scope paths in the drift check match the Scope section.
