# Changelog

All notable changes to the `meldom` plugin. The version is the one both manifests carry, and every release is
tagged `v<version>`.

## 0.2.0

- The full skill set: `using-meldom`, `implement`, `implement-spec`, `triage`, `improve`,
  `improve-codebase-architecture`, `wayfinder`, `issue-intake`, `review`, `skeptic`, `retro`, `sync-docs`,
  `prototype`, `diagnosing-bugs`, `grilling`, `bulletproof`, `ship`, `merge-worktree` and `to-tickets` join
  `guide` — twenty in all.
- The `meldom-worker` and `meldom-reviewer` agents ship with the plugin, so a skill that delegates works
  without the user installing agents by hand.
- Every cross-reference between skills is written in the namespaced, provider-neutral form
  ("invoke the `meldom:implement` skill"), so neither provider's invocation syntax is baked into the text.

## 0.1.1

- Probe release: a version bump with no content change, to measure how each provider refreshes a marketplace.

## 0.1.0

- First release: the plugin skeleton for Claude Code and Codex, and the `guide` skill.
